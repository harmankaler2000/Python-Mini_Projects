# Python-Mini_Projects
 These are the codes for the python begginer projects learnt from freecodecamp by Kylie Ying.

I learnt and implemented the following min-projects from the video:

Note: All the projects are CLI based.

- Madlibs : 

The idea behind it is to take input from the user for words and replace then in the blanks within a story based paragraph.

- Guess the number (Computer and User based):

This is a number guessing game made for both the user and the computer implemented in two different functions. 

- Rock Paper Scissior

A simple CLI based rock paper scissor game between you and the user.

- Hangman

Using a word.py file which has many english words in a list as the source. The user is challenged to a game of hangman.

- Tic Tac Toe:

A classic tic-tac-toe game for the user to play against the computer. The user is initialized to 'o' and compuet to 'x'.

- Binary Search

A python implementation of the binary search in comparison to the linear search using the time module over a random input.

- Minesweeper (CLI based)

A minesweeper game where the bombs are added to the board using the random module. Here, the user has to input the position to dig as row,col. If the dig is on a bomb the game ends.


- Sudoku Solver

This is a backtacking based sudolu solver.
